COMP3002 Artificial Intelligence - Assignment 1 readme
------------------------------------------------------

Everything is done via the commandline, and rather crudely
to so no trying to break it... The syntax is simply....

3dp puzzle_file type_of_search verbose_results(optional)

So if you wanted to do a BFS search on puzzle.txt without
tracing the nodes you simply type:-

3dp puzzle.txt b

To do the same thing with node tracing on just type:-

3dp puzzle.txt b v

NOTE: the commandline parammeters are case sensitive
